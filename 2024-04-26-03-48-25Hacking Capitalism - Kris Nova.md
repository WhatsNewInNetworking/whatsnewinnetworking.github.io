# Hacking Capitalism Kris Nova

 

### Ch 1: The System

 

- The tech industry is a ruthless but predictable system

 

- There are many subsystems that make up tech each with their own behavior, constraints, and impact.  Som subsystems are chaotic, others are stable.

 

- The tech industry exists because people want to profit with computers, the subsystems are implementation details that enable the broader system to function.  Technology has no concept of profit.

 

- The tech industry can come at a cost: exploitation

 

- Exploitation: The action/fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work

 

- The ideal conditions of well-funded and well-supported individuals are rare

 

- The tech industry will deliberately take from workers as many/as much resources as possible

 

- """

 

The happiest tech people I know are the ones that realize that tech companies are taking advantage of you and you have to do everything you can to reclaim as much value as possible

 

- Shantini Vyas, iOS Engineer

 

 

"""

 

- Understanding exploitation can help you understand how to take advantage of the tech industry which can offer insights into the thinking that created the industry itself

 

- Exploitation can be dangerous, but don't be dangerous yourself.  Be kind to others in the wider world, the tactics in this work won't function without compassion for yourself or others.

 

- The elite are a group of ruthlessly competitive people at the top, while there's no firm criteria for being part of "the elite" there are common characteristics including being externally competitive and internally collaborative.  The elite values competition/competitive behavior especially with those who don't look like them or work under them, and they associate vulnerability with weakness and risk.  The elite often look and think the same.

 

- The elite understand and embrace Capitalism and understand that profit is the only goal of the industry, as such they consider the harmful consequences of their actions to be valid operating costs (i.e. it's just business to rationalize immoral behavior).

 

- In general, the less competition in a highly valued space, the better

 

- Understand wehre the industry has/is directing more resources to figure out where there are high paying jobs/jobs with a better title/whatever your goal may be

 

- * The tech industry only cares about profit *

 

- Attach yourself to profit/productivity streams to leverage the system for a more effective ride to the top.

 

- Look for stability and well defined intellectual boundaries to predict the system and its subsystems

 

- There are some key behavioral, psychological, and technical components that make up the tech industry, namely: behavioral: competition/collaboration, psychological: building/breaking, technical: simplicty/complexity

 

 

- The tech world is built on multiple types of relationships including: direct relationships (more of this = more of that), inverse relationships (more of this = less of that), opposite relationships (less of this = more of that), opposed relationships (more of this = more of not-that)

 

- Many of the relationships are not called out explicitly but are key in modeling how you want to achieve your goals

 

- The tech industry usually interacts with resources in terms of time, people, or money to power and drive forth the variious systems.  Resources are key in the tech industry, otherwise it would have nothing to consume.

 

- Just as much as systems there are anti-systems that are often chaotic.  These areas of chaos that are within/adjacent to systems can provide some predictibility/patterns on how a system can act and can be a leverage point to gain access.

 

- Don't wait for doors to open, find the doors and open them as much as you can, be as creative and resourceful as you can

 

- Read the fine print and find opportunities to take advantage of there. 

 

- Where there's space for interpertation, there's space for misuse

 

- Exploit the system, before it exploits you

### Ch 2: Competition

 

- Competition is a key facet of the tech industry and understanding the process of competition can help protect you from harm

 

- Competition: The process of working in rivalry with the intent of outperforming others working toward the same goal

 

- Competition in the tech industry happens between individuals, departments, orgs, companies, etc...

 

- As you grow in title and influence in an org you'll grow closer to Capital so your impact and influence will become more relevant (i.e. you'll be closer to the market)

 

- Understanding the language of business is understanding the language of the tech elite

 

- The profit model under Capitalism depends on either increasing revenue or decreasing expenses, that's it, that's the game/focus for tech is either of those two concepts. 

 

- Tech often rewards masculine socialized traits including toughness, stoicism, heterosexism, self-sufficent attitudes, and a lack of emotional sensitivity

 

- Capitalism is built on the assumption that everyone who participates will focus on their own self-interest, while not offering many incentives for generosity or kindness. 

 

- Manipulating what the elite/powerful in tech or in a tech orginization percieve as their own self-interest can be a powerful tool toward getting the resources you need

 

- Tech will create tension between selfishness, your need for self-care, and selflesness

 

- Competitive chaos can lead to orginizational chaos which will lead to orginizational dysfunction and poor use of resources

 

- Communication that is low in context/information and built on unspoken assumptions is often provided by someone who is highly competitive and/or self-centered

 

- The ability to frame key technical decisions in ways that are favorable to the tech elite/Capital/Capitalism is incredibly important, whereas authentic representation can often be considered dangerous/combative.

 

- Beware of hypercompetitive bro types that try to exclude or block you from progress

 

- Since work bros rely on competition, you can give them a false competition to work toward.  If you can leverage their competition to help you in a collaborative manner

 

- If work bros become toxic at some point it becomes time to focus more on self-care and your needs

 

---

 

### Ch 3: Collaboration

 

- The antisystem of competition is collaboration.  Collaboration is the process of working together toward a common goal whereas cooperation is the process of working to achieve one's own goals as a part of a common goal

 

- Collaboration and collaborative groups can outperform competitors, in order to do so you'll need to find a reliable team of hackers

 

- * find a crew, work together, share everything you know *

 

- For collaboration to work there has to be a common trust that the collaboration is built on.

 

- Oftentimes an absence of trust can help explain orginizational dysfunction

 

- Those who tend toward collaboration/collaborative personality types aren't always rewarded or incentivized in the same ways as their more competitive counterparts

 

- Collaboraion increases the ability to scale whereas competition decreases the ability to scale as it creates rivalry and division and groups breaking into smaller groups.  Collaboration can be the quickest way to gain scale and with scale authority

 

- As the number of people who trust the decisions of a system increases, so does the authority of that system.  Generally authority can be inferred from trust and scale.

 

- The ability to drive collaboration and trust will yield a greater authority over decisions

 

- Systems/orgs my try to weaponize collaboration to exploit an individual

 

- If you don't trust a system/org you don't owe the system any collaboration in return.

 

- Good faith criticism of your work/collaboration can be used as a way to benchmark that your work is effective and a way to improve/strengthen your position

 

- High context communication is key for effective criticism that can be used to improve an artifact of work.

 

- Good faith criticism will offer clear feedback, be easily understood/digestible, and offer solutions to problems or offer how to collaborate to fix issues in the future

 

- Collaboration can be a key competitive edge that is built on trust.  But collaboration may not be the answer to everything as competition can drive innovation at times

 

- While competition may bring about technical innovation, collaboration can reinforce the innovation at greater scale.

### Ch 4: Ethics

 

- Companies/orgs have idealistic vs realistic code of ethics, find an leverage the differences between them

 

- Ethics present friction to Capitalism/Profit

 

- The system will not protect you, a code of ethics does not prevent unethical behavior

 

- YOU must create your own protection/community

 

- Collect data, write things down, figure out what methods work best for you

 

- Framework: Research/Analyze conflicts in the org, understand any dilemas, model intent and impact, understand ideal vs real nature of the system, determine the differences and opportunities

 

- Capitalism is only constrained by law and consequences, prioritize your own self interest

 

- Companies will not assume social responsibility, they only assume responsibility for pursuing profits

 

- Company loyalty is absurd within Capitalism

 

- If you don't advocate for yourself the system will exploit you

 

- Capitalism only cares about profit, not compassion

 

- Protect yourself, no one else will do it for you

 

---

 

### Chapter 5: Money

 

- While Cpaitalism runs on profit, it also seeks revenue streams

 

- Money invested -> Product informs manufacturing -> Manufacturing delivers product -> Marketing enables sales -> Sales creates revenue which leads back to money invested

 

- * Capitalism/elites view production as a problem to be managed, not as the people that makes it happen *

 

- Marketing/the market is at the edge of production

 

- Production is a vehicle for marketing/sales

 

- Production is designing/implementing a system that can be sold

 

- A paradox of Capitalism there's a state of conflict between an individual workers self interest and the interest of the orginization

 

- The better a company is at production the more money it will generally make

 

---

 

### Ch 6: Building

 

- The anxiety under Capitalism is real

 

- Building systems is key ot hacking Capitalism: Design it, make it, make it work, make it work well, make it work well for you

 

- Start simple, work on one phase at a time, build simple first, and then innovate later

 

- The make it step will be wonky and should only show that the project is possible

 

- In the make it work step, have simple definitions for success

 

- Make it work well, is about innovation and streamlining things/making things work and more efficent

 

- Every problem is an opportunity to exploit the system

 

- Architecting: Tactics -> Strategy

 

- Architects design the system end to end to solve the problem

 

- Observability gets information about a system state beyond what's obvious

 

- Operatability is the ability to change the internal state of a system based on external stimuli

 

- Hostility to users is when operability is taken away to maximize profits (e.g. having to call to cancel a subscription, or when an "unsubscribe" link doesn't work on purpose)

 

- Extensibility is enabling a broader system by allowing subcomponents of that system to do the work, standards come in handy with extensibility

 

- Build the boring bridges first to enable resource access, then build the fancy stuff

 

---

 

### Ch 7: Breaking

 

- Breaking lets you see a systems raw materials, intended uses, and unintended uses

 

- Building resilient systems means understanding that all systems will break eventually

 

- Breaking can be used to hack/gain information on/exploit systems

 

- Breaking is taking a dice roll on getting more resources

 

- One of the leverage points for breaking is understanding a systems purpose (what it does) vs. its intent (what it's meant to do)

 

- Break shit, see what happens.  There can be value, opportunity, and room for growth in breaking (think Chaos Monkey)

 

- Debris after havoc is a resource, it shows what remains

 

- Emergencies break down the fabric of the system and can create change (think Shock Doctrine)

 

- Eas to exploit at others expense, it's neutral to exploit with no impact to others, it's skillful to exploit and elevate others

 

- Resources are an opportunity to collaborate or compete

 

- Companies/orgs that repeat the same cycle of failure/destruction are ones you should be wary of.  In such orgs, position yourself near the most productive path.

 

- Where there is chaos, there's opportunity

 

- Identify build cycles and break cycles

### Ch 8: Open Source

 

- Collaboration: Common Goals, Cooperation: Working towards a common direction with independent goals, competitiion: Completely independent goals

 

- Linux: Collaborative envirionment with some cooperation from industry and many modular pieces of cooperation

 

- Linux is an example of open collaboration: a type of model that creates economic value without Capitalism's traditional incentives

 

- Open collaboration is to open source as the production cycle is to a traditional product

 

- Another good examble of open collaboration is Wikipedia

 

- Group decision making is the ability to present a decision, get consensus, and communicate a clear path/choice forward.  This choice can be leveraged to influence and org

 

- Modular flexibility: Breaking work down into reasonable components

 

- Architect/create architecture to create economic value

 

- Work cooperatively and transparently, transparency creates value

 

- * Transparency creates value *

 

- Have a journal of your work that is a highl visible artifact with a visible relationship/communications trail

 

---

 

### Ch 9: Influence

 

- Influence: The capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of others

 

- Influence is how impact/power is derived, authority can be given/awareded but authority does not equal influence

 

- Typically influence comes first, and then title/authority follow

 

- THere's no one path/formula for influence, other than it being an interpersonal skill that is on a case by case basis

 

- Start by listening/observing the situation and reinforcing the sentiments that align with your goals

 

- Influence can be thought of as offering hlepful suggestions/ideas to others

 

- Ideas can be valuable in the context of Capitalism and Capitalism often tells us to keep our ideas secret/protected for profit

 

- The paradox of keeping ideas vs giving them away is an individual choice

 

- Beware of adoption hype cycles

 

- Get good at sharing ideas with others and encoruge them to celebrate victories and get ideas adopted

 

- Those who communicate/present are those who influence the message.  The medium/presenter is the message and crafting the message.

 

- Influence is made up of ideas + adoption + presentation

 

- To influence you need to understand the importance of your ideas, how to get them adopted, and how to communicate the process

 

- Collaborate and share ideas, encourage the good parts, ignore the rest

 

- Encourage and reinforce adoptions, showcase/present that adoption, create incentives for people to adopt your idea

 

- Communicate the process well in a way that other can see and easily understand it

 

- Understanding is distinct from listening in that understanding is emptathizing and comprehending others experience.

 

- Understanding is key to collaorative work because you have to understand what others want/need

 

- When in doubt, shut up and listen for understanding

 

- Being a part of leadership means being deliberate about how, when, where, and who you share your messages with

 

- Effective broadcasting of messages means making them easily digestible (start small, keep it simple)

 

- The ability to communicate complex ideas quickly/easily is what separates good influencers/communicators from great ones

 

- Simplify complex ideas, make them easy to understand/brandable

 

- Empathy is key to understanding and influence

 

- Advocacy is a public endorsement for an approach/idea and part of working on a project can be advocacy

 

- Advocacy is an easy way to get your ideas dopted and if your ideas are seen as valuable people will adopt them

 

- * In Capitalism there is no paid altruism *

 

- Social media is the best way to exercise your influence in Tech

 

- The myth of meritocracy under Capitalism is wildly believed under those with privelege

 

- The idea that you need to work hard to be rewarded isn't viable for everyone, people from marginalized groups need to take that reward, acknowledgement, and profit by force

 

- Things are never given away under Capitalism especially to those in marginalized groups

 

- Prioritize your self interest (pay yourself first) to hack Capitalism more effectively

 

- Influence is a primary currency in tech

 

- A simple way to communicate ideas is to answer two key questions: What is it? Why does it matter?

### Ch 10: Sustainability

 

- Sustainability: Ability to maintain effort at current rate/level/efficency

 

- You need to replenish yourself/your resources faster than using them for extended periods of time

 

- Understand the factors that help you grow and the factors that wear on you

 

- Capitalism will not pay you what you're worth, Capitalism is a system that inherently diminishes its resources

 

- Burnout is a constant state of redline, cause by overexertion without providing proper support/resources (i.e. do more with less mentality)

 

- Sustained pace via collaboration is key, endurance via sustained pace > fast pace that's short lived

 

- You won't always have control over all your currencies (time, energy, money) but advocating for your currency is key, make sure to spend your currency wisely

 

- YOU have to protect YOURSELF from exploitation

 

---

 

### Ch 11: Hacking

 

- Get the tools you need to do your work

 

- Surround yourself with the relationships, situations, and knowledge you need

 

- A successful workshop is unique to each hacker

 

- Don't become dependent on any one tool

 

- Scan/target companies that can help you achieve your goals/outcomes

 

- Separate out your goal from how you intend to achieve it (e.g. adding a technology to your resume is the intended outcome, then getting a job at a well known tech company might be the means of achievement)

 

- After selecting the target you want, choose the attack and communication vectors, and understand how to attack/fit into the org

 

- Spend time finding problems that make sense for you, and then try to map them to the resources you want (money, time, energy, etc...)

 

- The more uncommon your skillset, the more value you'll have toward solving specific problems

 

- Never underestimate the value of a good transition (lateral movement)

 

- Privlege escalation/hacking Capitalism is using tactics such as influence, collaboration, broadcasting, and social engineering to gain access to elevated levels at a tech corporoation/org

 

- For priv esc, identify a viable path, potential resources needed, and then pursue that path

 

- Escalate wisely and have a clean/clear exit strategy

 

- * A job is a way to a paycheck, and a paycheck is a way to your dreams *

 

- If you don't continiously grow toward your goals, the tech industry will exploit you until there's nothing left

 

- A hack environment can be useful for hacking future environments
