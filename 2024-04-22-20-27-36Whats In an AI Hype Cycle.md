# What is a hype cycle

 

In the current technology environment AI is currently garnering all the hype.  Given previous cycles around Machine Learning, Data Science, Neural Networks, and other such technologies it can be useful to examine hype cycles through a framework/lens and see how this could impact the technological landscape.

 

The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle) is a useful framework here since it's well established and provides the steps of what hype looks like/how it functions. 

 

A hype cycle in my opinion can be best described as "irrational exuberance" which do not match up with the constraints of reality (basically the new tech/framework promises everything under the sun).

 

 

The Gartner hype cycle has 5 phases: Trigger, Inflated Expectations, Trough/disillusionment, Upswing/Enlightenment, and Plateau.

 

With AI a new technology has "emerged" (despite having roots as far back as the 1950's with Turing's paper on Computing Machinery and Intelligence) that can seemingly upend current ways of doing things and augment/enhance current workflows, potentially at the cost of workers. 

 

Since the emergence of this latest AI boom there have been lots of promises made (my personal favorite is still the wearable AI devices that are difficult to use due to poor interfaces and slow connections) that are often beyond currenc capabilities in everything from healthcare, logisitcs, manufacturing, and up to lawn care (automated roomba style lawn mowers anyone?)

 

Even just a few days ago the Washington Post published an article that the ["AI Hype Bubble is Dying"](https://web.archive.org/web/20240418175030/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/18/ai-bubble-hype-dying-money/). Assuming that we are in that trough it will have impacts all through investments, the economy, and among workers.

 

With the upswing and plateau we still have to see what eventually shakes out as a good investment/useful allocation of resources.

 

So how does this impact networking?  Ultimately network automation via Terraform, Python, and other methods/platforms has been around for a bit and AI is just another layer on top of that. In the realm of networking AI isn't so much a revolution as an evolution of capabilities as it can handle boilerplate, update ports/assignments, and re-direct traffic as needed.  It's similar to the capabilities developers are seeing with AI in handling boilerplate code or having AI code relatively simple programs (with some trial and error).

 

If networking is the plumbing of the internet and orginizations, then there's still a healthy market for network engineers as AI is just another tool in the toolbox and is still a fair ways away from being able to solve a wide variety of layer 1 to layer 7 issues.
